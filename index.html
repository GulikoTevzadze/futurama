                <p>
                  Philip J. Fry (voiced by Billy West), primarily known by his
                  surname Fry, is the main protagonist of the series. He is a
                  20th-century pizza delivery boy in New York City who, after
                  getting dumped by his girlfriend and being stuck in a dead-end
                  job, is cryogenically frozen on December 31, 1999, waking up
                  1000 years later just before the year 3000. After meeting
                  Leela and Bender, the trio find employment at the Planet
                  Express delivery company, owned by Fry's distant descendant
                  Professor Farnsworth. Ironically, Fry becomes the delivery boy
                  for Planet Express after rejecting his predetermined job of
                  being a delivery boy upon waking up in the future. Fry is a
                  goofy, dim-witted, slovenly but well-meaning individual. The
                  series follows his transition from the 20th century to the
                  31st century. Billy West used an impression of his own voice
                  at age 25 to create Fry's voice.

                <p>
                  Turanga Leela (voiced by Katey Sagal) is the female lead of
                  the series. She is a one-eyed mutant who Fry meets after
                  waking up 1000 years in the future. Originally working as a
                  career assignment officer for cryo-preserved people waking up
                  in the future, Leela quits her job after meeting Fry, joining
                  him and Bender at Planet Express where she becomes the
                  delivery ship's captain. She is one of the few characters in
                  the cast to routinely display competence and the ability to
                  command, and routinely saves the rest of the cast from
                  disaster, but suffers extreme self-doubt because she has only
                  one eye and grew up as a bullied orphan. She first believes
                  herself an alien but later is revealed to be a mutant. Leela
                  is also an environmentalist. The series also follows the
                  relationship between Fry and Leela, as they start off as
                  friends but later develop feelings for one another.

                <p>
                  Bender Bending Rodríguez (voiced by John DiMaggio), designated
                  in-universe as Bending Unit 22, unit number 1,729, serial
                  number 2716057, is a humanoid industrial robot who rounds out
                  the main trio of characters. He fulfills a comic,
                  antihero-type role in Futurama and is described by fellow
                  character Leela as an "alcoholic, whore-mongering,
                  chain-smoking gambler". Fry meets Bender at a suicide booth
                  (which Fry mistakes for a telephone booth) after exploring the
                  city following his escape from the cryogenics facility he was
                  frozen at. After Fry gives Bender a reason to keep living, the
                  two are caught by Leela, who joins them in going to Planet
                  Express. Bender fulfills a variety of odd jobs at the company,
                  including the head chef, and is also Fry's best friend and
                  roommate.

                <p>
                  Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth (voiced by Billy West) is Fry's
                  great nephew and great grandson because of time reef paradox.
                  A mad scientist and the proprietor of Planet Express, he
                  alternates between intelligence and amoral senility due to his
                  greatly advanced age, stated to be at least 150 years old on
                  multiple occasions (160 years old as of "A Clone of My Own").
                  He demonstrates a mastery of any field of science necessary
                  for the series' plots and is suggested to be one of the most
                  brilliant inventors on Earth. However, he falls asleep
                  constantly, and he is implied to have routinely sent his
                  former crews on suicide missions. He wears very thick glasses
                  and has a gift for creating doomsday devices and atomic
                  supermen. He has put at least one parallel universe in peril
                  with his inventions and visited dozens more.

                <p>
                  John A. Zoidberg (voiced by Billy West), "M." D., commonly
                  known by his surname Zoidberg, is the staff doctor for Planet
                  Express, despite his poor understanding of human physiology
                  and allusions to his questionable credentials. He is a
                  Decapodian, an anthropomorphic crustacean-like species of
                  alien. His character parodies the supposed wealth and
                  automatic respect of modern doctors—for example, his
                  incompetence at human medicine makes him extremely poor
                  despite his profession, and he is implied to be frequently
                  homeless when not at work. The Decapod (named after the actual
                  Decapoda order of ten-footed crustaceans) are an extended
                  parody on Yiddish culture—the bigger joke being that shellfish
                  are not kosher. The writing riffs on the marine theme in a
                  playfully absurd way, with just about any marine Arthropoda or
                  Mollusca being implied to be akin to Zoidberg.
