                <p>
                  Philip J. Fry (voiced by Billy West), primarily known by his
                  surname Fry, is the main protagonist of the series. He is a
                  20th-century pizza delivery boy in New York City who, after
                  getting dumped by his girlfriend and being stuck in a dead-end
                  job, is cryogenically frozen on December 31, 1999, waking up 1000
                  years later just before the year 3000. After meeting Leela and
                  Bender, the trio find employment at the Planet Express delivery
                  company, owned by Fry's distant descendant Professor Farnsworth.
                  Ironically, Fry becomes the delivery boy for Planet Express after
                  rejecting his predetermined job of being a delivery boy upon
                  waking up in the future. Fry is a goofy, dim-witted, slovenly but
                  well-meaning individual. The series follows his transition from
                  the 20th century to the 31st century. Billy West used an
                  impression of his own voice at age 25 to create Fry's voice.

                <p>Turanga Leela (voiced by Katey Sagal) is the female lead of the series. She is a one-eyed mutant who Fry meets after waking up 1000 years in the future. Originally working as a career assignment officer for cryo-preserved people waking up in the future, Leela quits her job after meeting Fry, joining him and Bender at Planet Express where she becomes the delivery ship's captain. She is one of the few characters in the cast to routinely display competence and the ability to command, and routinely saves the rest of the cast from disaster, but suffers extreme self-doubt because she has only one eye and grew up as a bullied orphan. She first believes herself an alien but later is revealed to be a mutant. Leela is also an environmentalist. The series also follows the relationship between Fry and Leela, as they start off as friends but later develop feelings for one another.</p>

                <h3 id="bender">Bender Bending Rodriguez</h3>
                <p>Bender Bending Rodríguez (voiced by John DiMaggio), designated in-universe as Bending Unit 22, unit number 1,729, serial number 2716057, is a humanoid industrial robot who rounds out the main trio of characters. He fulfills a comic, antihero-type role in Futurama and is described by fellow character Leela as an "alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler". Fry meets Bender at a suicide booth (which Fry mistakes for a telephone booth) after exploring the city following his escape from the cryogenics facility he was frozen at. After Fry gives Bender a reason to keep living, the two are caught by Leela, who joins them in going to Planet Express. Bender fulfills a variety of odd jobs at the company, including the head chef, and is also Fry's best friend and roommate.</p>

                <p>Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth (voiced by Billy West) is Fry's great (×30) nephew and great (×31) grandson because of time reef paradox. A mad scientist and the proprietor of Planet Express, he alternates between intelligence and amoral senility due to his greatly advanced age, stated to be at least 150 years old on multiple occasions (160 years old as of "A Clone of My Own"). He demonstrates a mastery of any field of science necessary for the series' plots and is suggested to be one of the most brilliant inventors on Earth. However, he falls asleep constantly, and he is implied to have routinely sent his former crews on suicide missions. He wears very thick glasses and has a gift for creating doomsday devices and atomic supermen. He has put at least one parallel universe in peril with his inventions and visited dozens more.</p>

                <p>John A. Zoidberg (voiced by Billy West), "M." D., commonly known by his surname Zoidberg, is the staff doctor for Planet Express, despite his poor understanding of human physiology and allusions to his questionable credentials. He is a Decapodian, an anthropomorphic crustacean-like species of alien. His character parodies the supposed wealth and automatic respect of modern doctors—for example, his incompetence at human medicine makes him extremely poor despite his profession, and he is implied to be frequently homeless when not at work. The Decapod (named after the actual Decapoda order of ten-footed crustaceans) are an extended parody on Yiddish culture—the bigger joke being that shellfish are not kosher. The writing riffs on the marine theme in a playfully absurd way, with just about any marine Arthropoda or Mollusca being implied to be akin to Zoidberg.</p>
